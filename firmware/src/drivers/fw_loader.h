/*
 * fw_loader.h — firmware image staging, caching, and installing over the
 * CDC debug shell.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Every reflash of this firmware used to need MENU+Power and the stock IAP
 * channel. This module makes the USB cable the whole story: an image is
 * streamed over the CDC shell into a cache slot on the W25Q (16 MB — two
 * 1 MB slots, so THIS firmware's own image fits, and so does the 2C23T
 * port's), verified at rest, and installed by a RAM-resident copier that
 * ends in a clean system reset. Both cache slots use the same manifest
 * format as the 2C23T port's fw_cache.c, so either firmware can install
 * an image the other one cached — switching between them is one command
 * (or one file drop) with no buttons and no cable fiddling.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT
 * ------------
 *   fwload <size> <crc32> [a|b]   stage: CDC RX is rerouted here until
 *                                 <size> raw bytes arrive; they stream
 *                                 into cache slot a/b (default b) on the
 *                                 W25Q via the audited flash_regions
 *                                 layer. On completion the slot is
 *                                 re-read, CRC-checked AT REST, vector-
 *                                 checked, and only then its manifest is
 *                                 written — a torn transfer can never
 *                                 look installable.
 *   fwstat                        state machine, byte count, slot table.
 *   fwapply                       install the just-staged slot.
 *   fwswap a|b                    install a previously cached slot — no
 *                                 host transfer at all.
 *
 * SAFETY POSTURE
 * --------------
 *   - Staging never touches the running app; abort/timeout just returns
 *     the shell. The manifest-last discipline means half-filled slots
 *     are invisible to every installer.
 *   - Install re-verifies the ENTIRE slot (manifest, full CRC, vector
 *     shape) at the moment of truth, copies with read-back verification,
 *     and SYSTEM-RESETS into the new image (a cross-firmware jump was
 *     bench-tried and half-bricks). Run it on USB power: PC9 drops
 *     during the reset, and the cable carries the rail — which fwapply
 *     guarantees by construction.
 *   - Nothing here can write below 0x08007000: the factory IAP
 *     bootloader is untouchable by construction, and MENU+Power remains
 *     the recovery path after ANY outcome.
