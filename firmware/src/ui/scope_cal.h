/*
 * OpenScope 2C53T — per-channel, per-range vertical calibration
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 * ------------
 * One number per (channel, range): how many millivolts at the probe tip one
 * ADC count is worth. Everything vertical the instrument claims — Vpp, Vrms,
 * the volts/div in the status bar, cursor deltas — is that number times a
 * count. There is nothing else in the vertical path.
 *
 * WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM
 * ---------------------------
 * docs/experiments/2026-08-17-08-per-range-gain-ladders.md, bench unit #1.
 * Slope method: span measured at five drive amplitudes per range, mVpp
 * regressed against counts, so the constant noise-floor term lands in the
 * intercept instead of inflating the gain. n = 5 on every entry below.
 *
 * WHY THERE ARE TIERS
 * -------------------
 * The measurement is not equally good everywhere, and the previous version of
 * this table (two hardcoded constants in scope_ui.c) is the reason the
 * distinction is now structural rather than a comment. Those two constants
 * claimed 2.882 mV/count on range 2 and 6.494 mV/count on range 8. Range 2
 * rails on both channels and produces no usable span at all, and range 8
 * measures 279 mV/count — a factor of 43 out. They were plausible, stable,
 * and wrong, and they had been on the instrument face for days.
 *
 *   MEASURED     ranges 5/6/7. The two channels agree within 6%, the ladder
 *                is a clean 1-2-4 doubling, and the numbers reproduce BOTH an
 *                independent mux-code sweep on this unit (EXP-06: 21.23 /
 *                42.04 / 91.41) and Stlkv's measurements on a DIFFERENT unit
 *                with a different rig (20 / 40 / 80). Three methods, two
 *                units, one answer.
 *   PROVISIONAL  ranges 4/8/9. Measured the same way, but the two channels
 *                disagree by 25-48%, which is the signature of one fixed
 *                amplitude set under-serving both ends of the sweep: too
 *                small to move range 9, big enough to clip range 4. The
 *                number is the right order of magnitude and nothing more.
 *   NONE         ranges 0-3. Both channels rail. EXP-11 split this into two
 *                different faults: 0/1/2 sit at 255 even with NO input and
 *                after centring, so they are pinned rather than overdriven;
 *                range 3 is a genuine sensitive row (~5.6 mV/count) that
 *                clips because its offset cannot be centred — the injector
 *                runs out of travel. Range 3 is therefore a firmware problem,
 *                not a dead tap, and is the one worth chasing.
 *
 * A PROVISIONAL entry still returns a number, because "roughly 280 mV per
 * count" beats a raw count for a user trying to read a trace. A NONE entry
 * returns 0.0f and the caller MUST fall back to honest ADC counts. That
 * contract is the whole point: a confident wrong number is worse than a raw
 * count, and callers are not allowed to invent one.
 *
 * THE ABSOLUTE SCALE IS ONE MULTIPLY AWAY FROM CORRECT
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * Every number here traces back to an amplitude *commanded* from the ESP32
 * signal generator, which has never been checked against a calibrated source.
 * Its frequency readback is already known to be off by ~0.82x, so assuming
 * its amplitude is exact would be optimistic. If it turns out to be off by a
 * scale factor, every entry in this table is off by that same factor —
 * uniformly, because they were all taken through the same source on the same
 * evening.
 *
 * That is why SCOPE_CAL_SOURCE_SCALE exists and is applied to every entry at
 * lookup time rather than baked into the table. When a trusted source arrives
 * on the bench, measuring ONE range recovers the factor and correcting it
 * here rescales the whole instrument. Do not "fix" individual rows by hand
 * to make them agree with a reference; that would break the one property
 * that makes this recoverable.
 *
 * WHAT THIS TABLE IS NOT
 * ----------------------
 * - Not per-unit. These are bench unit #1's numbers compiled into the image.
 *   Factory per-device cal exists in MCU flash at 0x08006000 (see
 *   docs/experiments and the factory-cal memory note) and our app overwrites
 *   it. Wiring that up is a separate job.
 * - Not offset. This is gain only. The zero point is set by the per-channel
 *   vertical-offset reference (DAC1/PA4 for CH1, TMR13/PA6 for CH2) and is
 *   re-centered per range by `fpga scope center`.
 * - Not horizontal. The sample-rate table lives in scope_timebase.c, built
 *   2026-08-19 to this header's own prescription: the rate is measured per
 *   reg-0x01 code, tiered, and callers refuse to print seconds/Hz when
 *   there is no entry. (The claim that "the capture does not resolve
 *   frequency at all" was WITHDRAWN by EXP-10 on 2026-08-18 — it was a
 *   double FFT in the measuring script, not a hardware defect.)
